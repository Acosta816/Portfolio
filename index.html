                <h2>Bio:</h2>
                <p>I am a current student of Thinkful's Full Stack Web Dev. Engineering Program. I have an intrepid and insatiable magnetism for what drives our collective ascension as people. I find that the world is as much connected by code as it is by thoughts, chatter, and matter.  I'd like to help taylor that fabric and create for others the seams that connect us currently and have the world grow well beyond the physical limits and into an ever-expansive fabric that houses our greatest creative endeavours, our thoughts archived, our dreams realized and our hopes yet to be.  No but seriously, I love coding and building. I like people and working with. The chances to improve are always there, and I'm always looking.</p>
